mbrdt: An R Package for Multistage Binomial Reliability Demonstration Test (MBRDT) Design

The mbrdt package provides tools for designing multistage binomial reliability demonstration tests (MRDTs). It allows researchers and practitioners to simulate and optimize the costs of MBRDT designs, considering the multi-stage acceptance uncertainties and the potential subsequent costs of RDT, such as reliability growth cost and warranty service cost.
